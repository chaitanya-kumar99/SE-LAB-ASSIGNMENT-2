Software Engineering is a discipline that involves the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from requirements gathering and analysis to testing and deployment, with the goal of producing high-quality software that meets user needs and is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
Once requirements are gathered and the software is designed, the development phase involves writing code according to the design specifications. This includes choosing appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and tools, as well as adhering to coding standards and best practices.
